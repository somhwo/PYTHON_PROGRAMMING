    "Using try/except for input validation in Python is considered the most robust and Pythonic approach, especially when working with numeric inputs such as integers, floats, negatives, or scientific notation. This method directly attempts to convert the input and gracefully handles any errors that arise, ensuring that all valid numeric formats are accepted and invalid ones are caught without duplicating the internal logic of type conversion. In contrast, pre-validation using str.isdigit() is only suitable for positive integers, as it fails for negative numbers (e.g., \"-5\"), decimal numbers (\"3.14\"), and scientific notation (\"2e3\"), and may even allow some Unicode digits that cannot be parsed by int(). Therefore, while str.isdigit() is fast and simple for basic checks, it is insufficient for general numeric input validation, making try/except the preferred strategy for programs that require flexibility and reliability in handling user input, as emphasized in your lectures on arithmetic operators, exceptions, and input handling."
